# live-coding-frankfurt

This repo is meant to serve as an accompany to the [Live Coding Frankfurt meetup group]().

Here we gather links to resources and eventually results of our sessions and workshops.

## What is Live Coding?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) says:

> Live coding (sometimes referred to as 'on-the-fly programming', 'just in time programming' and 'conversational
> programming') is a performing arts form and a creativity technique centred upon the writing of source code and the use
> of interactive programming in an improvised way.

But pictures are better than words, so here are a few examples of what can be considered live coding

## How can I do live coding?

[Toplap's]() list of [awesome-livecoding](https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding) resources contains a nearly
exhaustive list of languages, libraries, tools which can be used to live code audio or visual performances. Plus it
lists quite a few videos and articles

## Systems/Languages for Live Coding

The following is only very small excerpt of all the existing systems, and we don't aim to replicate the already very
expansive list of [awesome-livecoding](https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding). Best have a look there, if you
want an extensive overview, or if you're looking for some kind of special tool/system/language.
