# live-coding-frankfurt

This repo is meant to serve as an accompany to the [Live Coding Frankfurt meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Live-Coding-Frankfurt).

Here we gather links to resources and eventually results of our sessions and workshops.

## What is Live Coding?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) says:

> Live coding (sometimes referred to as 'on-the-fly programming', 'just in time programming' and 'conversational
> programming') is a performing arts form and a creativity technique centred upon the writing of source code and the use
> of interactive programming in an improvised way.

But pictures are better than words, so here are a few examples of what can be considered live coding

## How can I do live coding?

[Toplap's]() list of [awesome-livecoding](https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding) resources contains a nearly
exhaustive list of languages, libraries, tools which can be used to live code audio or visual performances. Plus it
lists quite a few videos and articles

There's also the very extensive [awesome-creative-coding](https://github.com/terkelg/awesome-creative-coding) list,
which goes beyond live coding but has lots more resources on how to get creative with code.

## Systems/Languages for Live Coding

The following is only very small excerpt of all the existing systems, and we don't aim to replicate the already very
expansive list of [awesome-livecoding](https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding). Best have a look there, if you
want an extensive overview, or if you're looking for some kind of special tool/system/language.


### [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) (C/Smalltalk)

- Platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.
- Features `sclang`, an interpreted programming language for creating sound & music.

### [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) (Ruby)

- The Live Coding Music Synth for Everyone.
- Needs installing
- Control synths, samples and FXs with Ruby
- [mehackit has a very comprehensive and easy to follow tutorial](http://sonic-pi.mehackit.org/)

### [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) (Haskell)

- Domain specific pattern language in Haskell.
- Compact syntax with big musical impact.
- Specially good for rhythmic patterns and getting people to dance.
- Uses SuperColliders as audio backend.

### [FoxDot](http://foxdot.org/) (Python)

- Control SuperCollider by programming Python.

### [Gibber](https://gibber.cc/) (JS)

- "Gibber is a creative coding environment for audiovisual performance and composition. It contains features for audio
  synthesis and musical sequencing, 2d drawing, 3d scene construction and manipulation, and live-coding shaders."
- Runs completely in browser
- Does Audio and Visual

### [LiveCodeLab](http://livecodelab.net/) 

- "you can make fancy "on-the-fly" 3d visuals and play awesomely offbeat (literally) sounds"
- Runs completely in browser
- More focused on visuals than music

### [Fluxus](http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/) (LISP family)

- Actually a game engine that can produce audio and 3D Visuals in real time.
- The code is always embedded on top of the performance with dynamic font ("Show us your screens!")

### Notable Mentions

#### [Loop Drop](http://loopjs.com/)

"Loop Drop is a looper, modular synth and sampler designed for improvisation and live performance."
It's not controlled by source code, but rather with MIDI input devices or the keyboard

#### [Jazzari](https://jackschaedler.github.io/jazzari/)

Make Music with Javscript in your Browser and make three characters move

### Generative Music

### [midio](https://github.com/evangipson/midio)

"midio is a web-based generative synthesizer "radio" which uses the Web Audio API and TypeScript to create intertwining,
evolving musical phrases on the fly."

### [fluX](https://github.com/pd3v/fluX)

"A javascript engine for generative music in the browser"
